Below are some higher-level architectural and code-organization recommendations to help modularize the code base and remove redundancy. These suggestions are meant to preserve your existing functionality while making the code base more maintainable and scalable over time.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Create a Separate Data Module for Question Banks ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Currently, BibleQuestionBank.swift is large and contains numerous hardcoded questions for Exodus (and presumably future expansions). As your code base scales (e.g., adding more books, more questions, or more data fields), this single file may become unwieldy. A few ways to improve:

• Move Question Data into JSON Files or Other Data Resources: Instead of hardcoding questions in Swift structs, store them in JSON files—perhaps one JSON file per Bible book (e.g., exodus.json, genesis.json, etc.). This allows you to: – Keep question data separate from logic. – Easily add/edit questions without recompiling (within reason, as needed). – Potentially swap out data sources or add localization in the future.

• Create a “Data” or “Resources” folder (or module) that holds: – All question JSON files. – A small Swift struct or data loader that decodes the JSON into [Question] objects.

• Turn BibleQuestionBank into a Thin Data-Loading Utility: – The existing static methods (getQuestions, etc.) can simply load from the local JSON at run time (or compile time if needed). – If you have multiple Bible books, you can unify them by reading multiple JSON files and combining them into a single in-memory store or caching them as needed.

Example Sketch:

// Example data in exodus.json (pseudo-example) [ { "text": "How many plagues did God send upon Egypt?", "options": ["7", "10", "12", "3"], "correctAnswerIndex": 1, "book": "Exodus", "difficulty": "Easy", "verseReference": "Exodus 7–11", "verseText": "…" } ]

// In a new Data layer struct QuestionsDataLoader { static func loadQuestions(for book: BibleBook) -> [Question] { // e.g., load file named "(book.rawValue.lowercased()).json" // decode JSON into [Question] // return the resulting array } }

Then BibleQuestionBank might become: struct BibleQuestionBank { static func getQuestions(for book: BibleBook? = nil, difficulty: Difficulty? = nil) -> [Question] { // Either load all books or specific book(s), then filter by difficulty } }

This structure dramatically reduces code duplication in BibleQuestionBank.swift and improves maintainability.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 2. Eliminate Duplicate “Difficulty Color” Logic ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

It looks like the project has two approaches for color-labelling difficulties:

• In ContentView.swift (extension Color with difficultyColor)
• In AppTheme.swift (AppColors.difficultyColor)

Pick one centralized approach so you only have to maintain the difficulty→color mapping in a single place. For instance:

• Remove the extension in ContentView.swift.
• Always refer to AppColors.difficultyColor(difficulty).

Or vice versa—whichever is your stylistic preference, but having a single definition will avoid inconsistencies and duplication.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 3. Consolidate Shared UI Modifiers and Styles ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You already have ButtonStyles.swift, ViewModifiers.swift, and AnimationUtils.swift. Keep going in that direction:
• If you find repeated button styling code in multiple Views, sealing that logic into a custom ViewModifier or Style keeps code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).
• Similarly, repeated use of transitions, animations, or layout tweaks can be placed in a single folder or file (e.g., “Animations” or “Transitions”) and consistently referenced throughout the code base.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 4. Keep ViewModels Lightweight ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Your QuestionViewModel is already fairly clean, but a few tips to keep it from bloating as you add more complexity:
• Offload “pure data logic” (like advanced question filtering, randomization, etc.) to a separate data or service layer.
• Keep the “ViewModel” primarily for bridging data to the SwiftUI Views and handling user events.

As you expand more features (timer, network calls, daily devotionals, etc.), consider separate modules for each large piece of logic so the view model responsibilities don’t become too large.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 5. Use Protocols or Extensions for Repeated “Question” Behaviors ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

If you foresee extension points for the Question struct or repeated logic around question-shuffling, correctness-checking, etc., consider:

• A Protocol: e.g., QuestionProviding.
• Static Utility: e.g., an extension on Array where Element == Question.

Example:

extension Array where Element == Question { func shuffledOptions() -> [Question] { // Return a new array with each question’s options shuffled } }

This helps keep question-related logic discoverable and typed, rather than scattering small methods throughout the code base.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 6. Keep Testability in Mind ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You have REATests and REAUITests targets. By moving your question data and logic into separate modules or data-layer files, it becomes easier to unit-test them:

• You can write direct unit tests (e.g., verifying that getQuestions(for:.exodus) returns the correct array count or that filtering by .easy difficulty works properly).
• You can test the randomization logic (e.g., ensure it truly randomizes properly).

A modular approach also ensures your UI tests and unit tests can focus on their respective areas without needing the entire monolithic code base in every test.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 7. Summary of Recommended Folder and Module Breakdown ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Below is an example high-level structure after applying these suggestions. Actual organization may vary based on your project’s needs, but this can be a starting point:

▸ Data (or “Resources”)
• exodus.json
• leviticus.json
• …(other .json files)…

▸ Models
• Question.swift
• BibleQuestionBank.swift (now a thin aggregator or loader)
• Possibly a “DataLoader.swift” that handles JSON decoding

▸ ViewModels
• QuestionViewModel.swift
• Additional specialized view models if needed in the future

▸ Views
• ContentView.swift
• SelectionView.swift
• OptionView.swift
• Any other custom SwiftUI views

▸ Views/Shared (or “UIComponents”)
• ButtonStyles.swift
• ViewModifiers.swift
• AnimationUtils.swift
• AppTheme.swift

Tests
• REATests
– TestBibleQuestionBank.swift
– TestQuestionViewModel.swift
• REAUITests
– UI tests for navigating quiz, answering questions, etc.

With this structure, question data is in external resources, the logic to load/parse them is in a small dedicated layer, and your “ViewModel” and “Views” remain as separated as possible from the raw data details.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Overall, these steps should help you keep your code base well-organized, more modular, and easier to maintain as you grow the application. By extracting question data into external resources, consolidating repeated style or color logic, and assigning clear responsibilities to each layer (UI, ViewModel, Data), you’ll reduce redundancy and set the stage for easier expansions in future updates.
